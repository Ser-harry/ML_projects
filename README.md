# My Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my machine learning repository! ðŸš€

## About This Repo

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into the world of machine learning. It includes projects where I explore and implement various machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Projects

- **Rainfall Prediction**: My first project, where I utilize several machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees

- **Football Analysis with YOLOv5**: A cool project I learned from a [https://youtu.be/neBZ6huolkg?feature=shared) where I use the YOLOv5 model for analyzing football games, detecting players, and tracking their movements on the field.

## My Passion for Machine Learning

I'm just getting started, but I'm incredibly passionate about machine learning and excited to learn and grow in this field. I believe in the power of data and algorithms to make meaningful predictions and drive impactful decisions.

## Thank You!

Thank you for stopping by my repository! I hope you find my projects interesting. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or contribute!

_Happy Learning! ðŸ˜Š_
