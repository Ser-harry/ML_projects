# Project: Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This is an optional Honors Project, but it is highly recommended to complete. The goal of this project is to apply the machine learning skills you have acquired over the past five weeks to a real-world dataset. You will build a classifier to predict whether it will rain the following day based on a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
- Use a rainfall dataset, either provided by the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology or downloaded from [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillUp/labs/ML-FinalAssignment/Weather_Data.csv), to build a classifier.
- Clean the dataset and prepare it for machine learning.
- Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict whether there will be rain the following day.

### Algorithms to Use

You are expected to build and compare models using the following algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Logistic Regression**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of each model, use the following metrics (where applicable):

1. **Accuracy Score**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
2. **Jaccard Index**: A measure of the similarity between the predicted and actual sets.
3. **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
4. **Log Loss**: Logarithmic loss for evaluating the accuracy of a classifier's predictions.
5. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values.
6. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
7. **R2-Score**: The coefficient of determination that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain the dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology or download it from [here](#).
2. **Clean the Data**: Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for model training.
3. **Train the Models**: Implement the algorithms listed above and train your models using the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluate the Models**: Use the evaluation metrics to compare the performance of each classifier.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Results and Analysis

After building the models, evaluate their performance using the specified metrics. Provide an analysis of the results, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each model. Discuss any challenges faced and insights gained during the process.

## Conclusion

Summarize your findings and highlight which model performed best in predicting rainfall. Provide any suggestions for further improvements or alternative approaches that could be explored in future work.
